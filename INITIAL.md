# Feature Request Template

## FEATURE:
We want to devlop our existing deepagent application.
We want to develop the netbox_agent.py which currently has a significant gap in the netbox mcp tool coverage
- Total NetBox MCP Tools Available: 62 tools
- Explicitly Wrapped Tools: 8 tools (13% coverage)
- Unwrapped Tools: 54 tools (87% not directly accessible)
The current implementation uses manual wrapper functions for a limited set of core
  tools:

  # Only 8 tools are explicitly wrapped:
  netbox_agent = async_create_deep_agent([
      netbox_get_server_health,      # System tool
      netbox_get_site_info,          # Site management
      netbox_list_sites,             # Site discovery
      netbox_get_device_info,        # Device details
      netbox_list_devices,           # Device discovery  
      netbox_get_device_basic_info,  # Lightweight device info
      netbox_list_device_roles,      # Device role management
      netbox_list_device_types       # Device type catalog
  ])

# We want to develop Dynamic Tool Generation

# Phase 1: Implement Dynamic Wrapper Generation                                     
1. Create a dynamic wrapper generator that reads the TOOL_REGISTRY                
2. Generate async wrapper functions for all 62 tools automatically                
3. Include proper parameter mapping and type checking                             
4. Handle dependency injection (NetBox client) transparently

# Phase 2: Update Agent Configuration                                               
1. Replace manual tool list with dynamically generated tools                      
2. Update agent instructions to reflect actual available tools                    
3. Organize tools by category for better discoverability                          
4. Add category-specific guidance in instructions

# Phase 3: Enhanced Tool Discovery                                                  
1. Add tool discovery capabilities to the agent                                   
2. Allow agent to list available tools by category                                
3. Implement intelligent tool selection based on query analysis                   
4. Add fallback mechanisms for tool family switching


## EXAMPLES:
A list of example netbox queries can be found here - /home/ola/dev/netboxdev/netbox-mcp-docs/netbox-queries

## DOCUMENTATION:
- Information regarding the deepagents application code base currently developed can be found here - url:https://blog.langchain.com/deep-agents/ & https://docs.langchain.com/labs/deep-agents/overview
The netbox mcp server application used can be located here - /home/ola/dev/netboxdev/netbox-mcp

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
The netbox mcp server provides READ ONLY netbox api tools.
Do NOT make any changes to the codebase in /home/ola/dev/netboxdev/netbox-mcp
